# NUMORAQ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

NUMORAQ is a comprehensive, crypto-native financial management platform tailored for serious investors, Web3 enthusiasts, and financially curious individuals. It combines traditional finance tools with cutting-edge blockchain integrations, AI-powered advisory, and a gamified XP-driven user engagement system called "Degen Plans." The mission is to give users full control of their net worth across all asset classes — from fiat to DeFi — while incentivizing action, discipline, and education through community-driven systems.

## Application Overview

### Core Purpose

- Track and visualize total net worth across liquid (crypto, stocks, fiat) and illiquid assets (real estate, NFTs, collectibles)
- Offer gamified personal finance with XP, streaks, and loyalty-based tiers
- Deliver personalized, AI-powered financial advisory (GPT)
- Provide donation-based roles and wallet-linked premium features

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: Crypto investors, degen traders, and portfolio optimizers
- **Secondary**: Wealth builders, high-income earners seeking gamified control
- **Tertiary**: Community-first users interested in personal finance mastery

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS + Brutalist theme tokens
- Vite for build optimization
- React Context + Custom Hooks
- Unicorn Studio for role-based animations
- Custom Charts for projections and asset breakdowns

### Backend Stack

- Supabase for Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage, and Realtime
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all data layers
- Edge Functions for payment/webhook logic
- Stripe for Degen Plan subscriptions
- CoinGecko + custom live price APIs
- ChatGPT API for personalized AI advisory

### Infrastructure

- **Production**: numoraq.online

  - Frontend in progress at https://cms-numoraq.lovable.app/
- **CI/CD**: GitHub → Vercel → Supabase migrations
- **Backups**: Enabled via Supabase Pro tier

## User Experience (UX)

### Design Language

- Game-like tier UX (rank titles, color codes)
- Dark mode default, responsive grid layout

### Navigation

- Hamburger menu → dashboard sections
- Tiers and XP progress visible from nav
- "Dev Mode" UI toggles available to all users

### Onboarding

- Currently OFF — accessible only via "restart tutorial" on Simple Dashboard
- Simple Dashboard is not yet main; Advanced Dashboard is currently the default
- Onboarding to be reactivated once Simple Dashboard is promoted to default

## Monetization Strategy

### Degen Plans (Frontend: "Plans" / Backend: "Time Credit")

#### User-Facing Plans
- Monthly Premium: $9.99
- 3-Month Premium: $24.99
- 6-Month Premium: $44.99
- Yearly Premium: $79.99
- Lifetime Premium: $299

#### Backend Logic
- Subscriptions are stored as premium time credits (e.g., hours or timestamps)
- Time from trials and codes are also counted with metadata: source: trial, source: admin, stripe subscription, etc.
- If user upgrade to a new recurring plan, it adds up to remaining hours and extends premium state
- Stripe handles recurring billing; DB tracks expiration
- Admins can manually adjust time credit

#### Database Table: user_premium_status
- plan_type
- is_active
- premium_expires_at
- source
- activated_code

## Tier System & Role Logic

### Frontend
- Roles: NEWCOMER → WHALE based on XP

### Backend
- Tiers are based on user_points
- Points are cumulative; small tier purchases add up
- Stripe tiers convert to points → tier auto-upgrades based on thresholds
- Admins can manually add points in CMS (currently buggy)

#### Database Table: user_points
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| user_id | Linked to auth |
| total_points | Cumulative score |
| current_tier | Computed from points |
| source | (e.g. Stripe, referral, admin) |

## Known Technical Challenges

- Supabase Auth table is not exposing metadata (affects CMS + leaderboard)
- CMS is limited, buggy, and embedded inside dashboard (access via CTRL+SHIFT+E)
- Stripe tier purchases not reflecting roles
- Degen time stacking not showing in user config
- Admin codes are bugged (only works to assign to self, if admin, via cms panel and once)
- Admin points interface shows no feedback and has no effect (only works to assign to self, if admin, via cms panel and one time)

## Success Metrics (KPIs)

- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- XP accumulation rate
- Trial to paid conversion rate
- Tier upgrades via Stripe
- Referral activations
- GPT usage by tier

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Now)
- test.numoraq.online and proper CI CD to both prod and test/dev. Make sure database backups for test and prod are working well
- cms.numoraq.online to be setted up and synced instead of using admin panel on site (ctr+shift+e). This cms should have access to change and read data on test.numoraq.online. Then, we should be able to update/merge test to prod both on frontend (github) and database
- Fix degen stacking logic
- Fix points → tier auto upgrade
- Add tracking of source (trial/payment/code)
- CMS UI/UX overhaul
- Translations (finish)

### Phase 2
- Wallet sync for Solana + EVM
- NFT + DeFi price tracking
- More categories on liquid assets (NFT isnt a category yet)
- GPT financial persona advisor (degen, doomer, etc)
- Tier-based DevMenu skins (some with Unicorn Studio or Three.js animation) (based on Landing Page's implementation which works)
- Dashboard Popup (image for now), uploadable via CMS

### Phase 3
- DBeaver migration (for free backups)
- Mobile App
- Open banking sync
- Marketing & Awareness, Indexing

## CMS Functionality (admins)

- Create codes that add premium time for users (degen codes) with time defined by admin [without breaking the main logic and purchases via stripe]
- Create codes that add tiers for users (tiers) [without breaking the main logic and purchases via stripe]
- See most important databases and be able to visually manage them in a comprehensive way
- See the most important logs
- Manage Version Control (displayed for users)
- Living Documentation(advanced): Visually show admins how our structure work similar to a figjam board in a way that stays updated, maybe via script

## Conclusion

NUMORAQ is approaching MVP status, with most financial tracking systems functional and early gamification layers deployed. Degen and Tier logic exist in frontend and CMS with some working Stripe calls, but backend still needs time/point stack tracking. Admin tools are limited but viable, onboarding is paused until simple dashboard is default, and all development is happening on production until test.numoraq.online is launched. With fixes and refinement, NUMORAQ is positioned to lead crypto wealth tooling.
