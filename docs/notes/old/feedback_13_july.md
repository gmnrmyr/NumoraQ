1) Supabase: Something is blocking exposing auth users. I dont know what that is, but it's definitaly complicating what we're trying to achieve via cms panel and also displaying the leaderboard properly. For that, I need some guidance on how to proceed.

I think a good idea is to have a sublink like cms.numoraq.online instead of keeping it in our main dashboard.

2) I also think we need test.numoraq.online to be our test. and numoraq.online to be our main branch (prod) and have different branches for our database as well. I need to know how to proceed with that and how to handle the uploads to prod and backups on both of those instances.

3) I think we're in a stage where myself, with my knowledge find it super hard to proceed only with a.i. We've been burning too much cursor credits, i'm now spending time on supabase premium as well for backups. I think I need to spend sometime on learning before proceeding otherwise cursor will keep braking functionality that is arleady good in order to achieve what I'm asking for. And that has been happening for a while and has been hard to deal with. Also one thing that we adds break the other we had working, and it has been in a loop of spending money on credits, and still staying far away from a good product state.
