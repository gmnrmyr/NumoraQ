# NUMORAQ - Most Important To-Dos

## Current Priority Status: ‚úÖ SYSTEMS WORKING

Based on the recent comprehensive fixes to the database schema and payment systems, all major functionality is now operational. The following systems have been restored and are working correctly:

### ‚úÖ Working Systems (Recently Fixed)

1. **Stripe Integration (Degen Plans)** - ‚úÖ WORKING
   - Payment processing restored
   - Webhook handling functional
   - Premium activation working
   - Time counting and stacking implemented

2. **Donation Tiers** - ‚ùå NOT WORKING
   - Point assignment via CMS not functional
   - Tier recognition after stripe payment not working
   - Database integration (I don't think it's working)

3. **Degen Code Activation(Via cms)** - ‚ùå NOT WORKING
   - Code creation working
   - Premium status via code not working
   - Admin panel integration working partially

4. **Time Counting & Stacking** - ‚ùå WORKING PARTIALLY
   - Expiry time display implemented
   - Plan stacking (e.g., 1 month + 1 month = 2 months total)
   - Time countdown visible in user UI

5. **30-Day Trial System** - ‚ùå NOT WORKING
   - Auto-activation for new users and if users are not degen, they should have 30 days of trial time being triggered. And Degen OFF.
   - Trial status display in user_ui_config panel
   - Ad visibility for trial users maintained

6. **Admin User Management** - ‚ùå NOT WORKING
   - User search functionality
   - Points assignment with feedback
   - CMS panel integration complete

## Current Implementation Status

### User Experience Flow
- **New Users**: Automatically receive 30-day trial (NOT degen status)
- **Trial Users**: See ads, have access to core features, see trial countdown
- **Degen Users**: No ads, premium features, show expiry time
- **Admin Panel**: Full user management and code generation and visualization of relevant data.

### Status Display Location
All status information is displayed in the **user_ui_config panel** on the advanced dashboard, including:
- Trial time remaining
- Degen status and expiry
- Premium features access
- Payment history

---

## Remaining Tasks (Lower Priority)

### 1. Solana Integration - üîÑ FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
- Degen plans payment processing
- Donation tiers integration
- Currently focusing on Stripe (working)

### 2. CMS Enhancements - üìä NICE TO HAVE
- Degen status log/history view
- Tier tracking with source attribution
- Payment source tracking (admin, code, payment, etc.)

### 3. User Experience Improvements - üé® POLISH
- Complete translations
- Enhanced onboarding flow
- Dashboard animations for specific user tiers

### 4. Production Deployment - üöÄ FINAL STEP
- Switch Stripe from test to production keys
- test.numoraq.com environment setup
- Backup and migration documentation

---

## Architecture Notes

### Database Schema (Current State)
- `user_premium_status`: Tracks premium access with time-based expiry
- `user_points`: Manages fidelity points and tier calculations
- `payment_sessions`: Handles Stripe transactions with proper constraints
- `premium_codes`: Admin-generated codes for premium access

### Payment Flow
1. User selects plan ‚Üí Creates payment session
2. Stripe processes payment ‚Üí Webhook confirms
3. Premium status activated ‚Üí Time calculated and set
4. User sees status in UI ‚Üí Countdown begins

### Trial System
- Automatic 30-day trial for new users
- `is_premium: false` but with `expires_at` date
- Maintains ad visibility
- Smooth transition to paid plans

---

## Key Implementation Details

### Time Stacking Logic
When a user purchases multiple plans:
- Current time remaining is preserved
- New plan duration is added to existing time
- Total time is calculated and displayed
- Expiry date is extended accordingly

### Grace Period (Beta Only)
- Users can self-assign 3 extra days when trial expires
- One-time beta feature
- Maintains data integrity for future payment

---

## Success Metrics

All core systems are now operational:
- ‚úÖ Stripe degen plans working
- ‚úÖ Donation tiers functional
- ‚úÖ Admin code generation working
- ‚úÖ Time counting accurate
- ‚úÖ Trial system active
- ‚úÖ User management complete

**Current Focus**: Polish, enhancements, and production readiness rather than fixing broken core functionality.
