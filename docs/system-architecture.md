- **Donation System:**  
  Users can donate via crypto or (soon) PayPal to unlock badges, titles, and premium features.
- **Mobile-First, Brutalist/Modern UI:**  
  Responsive design with theme and accent customization.

---

## Main Panels

- **Dashboard:**  
  Central hub for all financial data, analytics, and projections.
- **Donation Page:**  
  Shows donation options, user tiers, and recognition.
- **Admin Panel (CMS):**  
  For site admins to manage CMS settings, wallets, premium codes, and users.
- **Dev Menu:**  
  Developer/debug panel for theme switching, testing, and code activation.
- **CMS Settings Panel:**  
  For editing site name, wallets, PayPal, upcoming features, and main color scheme.

---

## Theme System

- **Theme Classes:**  
  Visual themes are applied as classes on `<html>` (e.g., `theme-monochrome`, `theme-neon`, `theme-black-hole`).
- **Default Theme:**  
  Set via `:root` in [`src/index.css`](../src/index.css).  
  If no theme class is present, these variables are used.
- **Theme Switching:**  
  - Users can change themes via the Dev Menu or CMS.
  - Selected theme is stored in `localStorage.selectedTheme`.
  - On app load, [`src/main.tsx`](../src/main.tsx) applies the correct class.
- **Adding a New Theme:**  
  1. Add a `.theme-<name>` block in [`src/index.css`](../src/index.css).
  2. Add the theme to the Dev Menu and CMS selectors.

---

## Dev Mode

- **Access:**  
  Open the Dev Menu via the "DEV" button (bottom left).
- **Features:**  
  - Switch between all available themes for testing.
  - Activate premium/degen codes.
  - Debug user titles, roles, and access.
  - See current user status and donation level.
- **Implementation:**  
  See [`src/components/DevMenu.tsx`](../src/components/DevMenu.tsx) and [`src/components/devmenu/ThemeSelector.tsx`](../src/components/devmenu/ThemeSelector.tsx).

---

## Titles, Donation Tiers, and Access

- **Titles:**  
  User titles (e.g., CHAMPION, LEGEND, WHALE) are based on total donation points.
- **Donation Tiers:**  
  Each tier unlocks badges, premium features, and sometimes exclusive themes (see [DonationPage](../src/pages/DonationPage.tsx)).
- **Access Control:**  
  - Some themes (e.g., Black Hole, Dark Dither) are only available to users with certain titles or donation levels.
  - Logic for access is in [`useUserTitle`](../src/hooks/useUserTitle.ts) and theme selectors.
- **How Titles Work:**  
  - Titles are assigned automatically based on donation totals.
  - See the hardcoded tiers in [`DonationPage.tsx`](../src/pages/DonationPage.tsx) and [`useUserTitle.ts`](../src/hooks/useUserTitle.ts).

---

## CMS Settings

- **Where Settings Are Stored:**  
  CMS settings are managed via the `useCMSSettings` hook (`src/hooks/useCMSSettings.ts`).  
  These settings are fetched from Supabase and provided to the app.
- **How to Access Settings:**  
  Use the `useCMSSettings` hook in your component:
  ```tsx
  const { settings, loading } = useCMSSettings();
  ```
- **Common Settings:**
  - `website_name`: The name of the site, used in headers and footers.
  - `project_wallet_evm`, `project_wallet_solana`, etc.: Wallet addresses for donations.
  - `project_paypal_email`: PayPal email for donations.
  - Other settings may include feature toggles, theme defaults, and donation tiers.
- **Updating Settings:**  
  - Settings can be updated via the CMS admin panel (if enabled).
  - **Only users with `admin` or `superadmin` roles can access and update the CMS.**
  - Changes are reflected in the app after a reload or via live updates if supported.

---

## Main Hooks

- **useCMSSettings:**  
  Loads and updates CMS settings from the backend.  
  [`src/hooks/useCMSSettings.ts`](../src/hooks/useCMSSettings.ts)
- **useProjectSettings:**  
  Loads project-level settings for display and editing.  
  [`src/hooks/useProjectSettings.ts`](../src/hooks/useProjectSettings.ts)
- **useUserTitle:**  
  Determines user title and access based on donation points.  
  [`src/hooks/useUserTitle.ts`](../src/hooks/useUserTitle.ts)
- **useUnicornStudioAnimation:**  
  Handles loading and controlling dashboard animations.  
  [`src/hooks/useUnicornStudioAnimation.tsx`](../src/hooks/useUnicornStudioAnimation.tsx)
- **useAnimationToggle:**  
  Controls animation enable/disable state.  
  [`src/hooks/useAnimationToggle.ts`](../src/hooks/useAnimationToggle.ts)

---

## Backend & Data

- **Supabase:**  
  Used for authentication, CMS settings, and user data storage.  
  See [`src/integrations/supabase/`](../src/integrations/supabase/) and hooks above.
- **CMS Settings Table:**  
  Stores site-wide settings (wallets, PayPal, color scheme, etc.).
- **User Data:**  
  Stored in Supabase and localStorage for fast access and offline support.

---

## Interaction Between Theme, CMS, and Access

- **Theme Selection Order:**  
  1. Userâ€™s `localStorage.selectedTheme` (if set)
  2. CMS default theme (if set)
  3. Fallback to `:root` CSS variables
- **Access Control:**  
  - Userâ€™s title (from donation points) determines which themes and features are available.
  - Dev Menu can override for testing, but access checks still apply for premium themes.
- **CMS Access:**  
  - Only users with `admin` or `superadmin` roles can access the CMS/admin panel.

---

## Leaderboard

- **Points System:**  
  The leaderboard currently uses donation points (same as user titles) to rank users. In the future, this may be separated from donation points for more nuanced ranking.
- **Privacy:**  
  The leaderboard is private by default: it only shows anonymous users and your own position. No public user data is exposed.
- **Access:**  
  Leaderboard data is restricted at the Supabase backend level to ensure privacy and security.
- **Self-View:**  
  Logged-in users can see their own rank and points on the leaderboard.

---

## Beta Dashboard Animation Integration (Role-Gated, Local-First)

- Build and test the beta dashboard locally before deploying to production to avoid unnecessary Unicorn Studio credit usage.
- Integrate Unicorn Studio animations using the exact embed code for each role:
  - Champion+: Black Hole (`db3DaP9gWVnnnr7ZevK7`, 2000x900 or 400x400)
  - Whales+: Dark Dither (`h49sb4lMLFG1hJLyIzdq`, 1440x900)
  - Contributor 50+: DaTest (video placeholder)
- Animations must be displayed behind the header text, with play/pause controls and the animation ID visible for debugging.
- Role gating must be enforced in the hamburger menu and animation toggles (not just DevMenu).
- The beta dashboard link should appear in the hamburger menu for Whale+ users only, without disrupting existing navigation.
- Use minimal hacking nomenclature and subtle pixel art accents for the UI.
- Panels and navbar must use the same user data as the main dashboard.
- Refactor code to be modular (separate animation, UI, and data logic).
- Test all animations locally on multiple devices and provide fallbacks (static PNGs or videos) if needed.
- Track and minimize Unicorn Studio credit usage.
