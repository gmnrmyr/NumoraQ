Onboarding Flow
Written in 11 SEPT 2021

1) When users create acc, all logic should be kept (30day trial is gave to user)

2) User can decide wether to start with dummy data and or a new data.

3) If user choose dummy data, user can select types of dummy data by age & demographic type like Brazilian 18yo.

4) IF user choose new data, start from the total scratch and guide him to the steps.

5) After choosing dummy or new data, ask if user already knows their monthly spending or if he wants to get to know it. If he already knows the spending, skip this step. and go straight to fill monthly expenses (recurring). But explain him how it works. And that you can use schedule, activate and deactivate items and properly categorize them.

6) if he wants to get to know his monthly spending, we will go to the new screen (page) that will also be available on advanced dashboard for users to register each spending and our system will calculate. their monthly total and separated on categories in order for user just to click: EXPORT TO MONTHLY SPENDINGs (recurring) and ask overwite if user has already set. If not, that would be the first time user is setting the expenses, don't need any alert. User can also come back to this screen after. 

7) after monthly spending part is done -> User will get to know about the variable expenses. Those are complex, but basically goals are also set here. for example if you are buying an apartment in 3 years, you can set it as a variable expense and it will be after added to your illiquid assets (explained later)

8) portfolio. Explain users that we separate portfolio in two parts: liquid and iliquid assets. explain why, and why things that are in liquid is more like your bank and cash flow and iliquid is more like real estate, car, something you spent a lot and doesnt sell easily often with a click for example. Explain that most of these are manually set for better controls, but will also be able to sync with banks in the future.

9) User will set his liquid assets first. Explain what users can set and why he would scheduele it... it`s for planning, renting, ideas like that.
