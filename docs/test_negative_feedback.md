I will keep this updated as you do the changes and I test them.

1) When user has 3 months degen and purchases another month, does he gets 4 months of degen or at least it shows on user_ui_config panel that he has 4 months of degen? No. Tested, still show 3 months.

2) Is purchase of tiers working via stripe? No. Stripe confirms purchase, our site confirms purchase but it still display user as newcomer despite having purchased a tier.

3) are users being able to use degen codes that are generated via admin panel? No. Tested. Codes are being generated by admins properly, but when users try to use them, it says: could not find the activated_code colum on user_premium status in the chema cache. and when I chekck on admin panel it says the code was used, but the user is still not degen nor have time being triggered.

4) Are non degen users having 30 days of trial time being triggered and displayed on user_ui_config panel? No. Tested, they are not degen, but their trial time is not being triggered or displayed.

5) Are users that have already spent their 30 trial days and not payed being blocked to use the app? I can't tell, we have not found a way to test this.

6) are admins able to see a log showing: where this degen came from (payment, admin, code, etc.) Same as Tiers, where that tiers came from. (payment, admin gave, via leaderboard, etc.) and what databases track this data? No, this has not been added to admin panel.

7)  are admins being able to add points to users via the admin panel? No. Despite adding the correct UID and amount of points, there is no feedback on admin panel and the users are not recieving thise points.
