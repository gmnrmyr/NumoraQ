- [X] Fix Stripe integration (degen plans and donation tiers) [seems to be working partially] [works for degen plans correctly! But not for donation tiers!]


- [ ] Fix Solana integration (degen plans and donation tiers) (still not working)

- [ ] Fix CMS functionality (degen code creation and degen points assignment for admins) [partially working for degen codes] <--- working partially, cause it doenst apply the degen status, despite being shown as applied on cms. and I'm worried to ask you to make this work cause i dont want it to break the stripe functionality. but would be really nice to have it.

- [ ] User Management & UID System (for admins to assign points to users for tiers testing is not working)


----

- [ ] Make new users trigger 30 days free trial.


-----

- [ ] Make our test.numoraq.com work with proper documentation for me to actually work mainly on test and not on prod. but make me a way to update both backend,database and frontend to prod. also a way to backup everything on test.

- [ ] Finish all trasnlations, onboarding flow and simple dashboard.

- [ ] Fix the animations we are trying to implement on dashboard, like we have on landing page for specific users (Degen, and Specific Tiers).
