# FinDash Core Development TODO

## COMPLETED ✅
- ✅ Fixed ETH price display in exchange rates banner
- ✅ Improved mobile optimization for expense cards
- ✅ Added expense categories (housing, health, food, transportation, entertainment, utilities, personal, travel, trips, other)
- ✅ Enhanced mobile navigation with better section indication
- ✅ Made data management section collapsible
- ✅ Updated translations for expense categories
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive Portuguese translations
- ✅ Improved expense card mobile layout to prevent overflow
- ✅ Enhanced user settings panel with email as default user
- ✅ Updated PWA manifest for app-like experience

## HIGH PRIORITY 🔴
- 🔴 Fix expenses input field behavior (exits edit mode)
- 🔴 Improve unsaved changes detection (avoid false positives from live currency updates)
- 🔴 Better mobile optimization for task management (delete completed + add task in separate row)
- 🔴 Unified import/export system (move away from JSON+CSV confusion)
- 🔴 Allow users to reorder tasks and other items
- 🔴 Disable auto-load from cloud (currently loads after few seconds of inactivity)

## MEDIUM PRIORITY 🟡
- 🟡 Name change (FinDash already exists - consider OpenFinDash or similar)
- 🟡 Add PWA capabilities for app-like experience
- 🟡 Customize exchange rate display (let users choose BTC, ETH, etc.)
- 🟡 Auto-sort and manual sort options for all panes
- 🟡 Better copy and branding consistency check
- 🟡 Add user feedback/research link

## LOW PRIORITY 🟢
- 🟢 Auto-fetch NFT prices integration
- 🟢 SEO optimization for domain launch
- 🟢 Google Play Store release preparation
- 🟢 Landing page improvements with animations and AI-generated images
- 🟢 Modern style enhancements (noise, gradients, depth, brutalism)

## TECHNICAL DEBT 🔧
- 🔧 ExpenseTrackingEditable.tsx is 401+ lines - needs refactoring
- 🔧 Dashboard.tsx is 292+ lines - needs refactoring
- 🔧 Clean up unused imports and dead code
- 🔧 Improve TypeScript type safety across components

## NOTES 📝
- App is FREE and OPEN SOURCE (differentiate from paid alternatives)
- Users can only pay for donations or ad removal
- Focus on mobile-first design
- Maintain brutalist/modern aesthetic with gradients and depth
